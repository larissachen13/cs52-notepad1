##HW 3 Part 2 

* App does persist firebase data, content update , movement, submission, and deletion can be seen by multiple clients, the only thing that doesn't is the extra credit feature from part 1 (resizing the notes) 
* Tried using the authenication login feature, except the popup kept dissappearing before rendering
